 ## Plant Disease Detection
In this project, we have developed a plant disease classification model aimed at assisting concerned agents in identifying types of diseases in plants. By accurately diagnosing plant diseases, timely treatment can be administered, thereby mitigating potential crop losses. Our model utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to achieve high accuracy in disease classification.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models specifically designed for processing and analyzing visual data, such as images. CNNs have revolutionized various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

#### The PlantVillage Dataset:

The dataset consists of about 44000 images of plant leaves collected under controlled environmental conditions. The plant images span the following 14 species:
Apple, Blueberry, Cherry, Corn, Grape, Orange, Peach, Bell Pepper, Potato, Raspberry, Soybean, Squash, Strawberry, and Tomato.

The dataset contains a total of 38 classes of plant disease listed below:
