 ## Plant Disease Detection and Yield Estimation


In this project, we have helped consered agents to find the type of diseases in plants so that they can treat them on time and avoid major crop loss.We have done many research and then developed this model so that no caused is harmed.We have trained the model on a large dataset from kaggle,the link is provided below:

We have used CNN to train our model. CNN has different layers.

The PlantVillage Dataset
We use a publicly available and quite famous, the PlantVillage Dataset. The dataset was published by crowdAI during the "PlantVillage Disease Classification Challenge". 

The dataset consists of about 44000 images of plant leaves collected under controlled environmental conditions. The plant images span the following 14 species:

Apple, Blueberry, Cherry, Corn, Grape, Orange, Peach, Bell Pepper, Potato, Raspberry, Soybean, Squash, Strawberry, and Tomato.

The dataset contains a total of 38 classes of plant disease listed below:
